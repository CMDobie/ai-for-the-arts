Copilot is trained from a vast amount of data across the internet so that it can give an informed response to any question that the user might pose. Although in other notebooks the reliability of this tool has been questioned, LLMs in general are mainly serving the purpose of aiding a human's task so it can be completed more efficiently.\n",

    "The audience for this sort of applications is vast and it has many uses. However, to focus on one particular audience it would be academics. This can be said for students and lecturers/teachers. In terms of how it can augment learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When conducting research, it can be used to ensure that the resources gathered are in fact real and genuine material. It can be quite easy to be convinced that something is real on the internet even when it is not, so having a tool that can spot details in content that the human-eye might not be able to would be helpful when conducting research as it means no false information is being referenced.\n",
    "2. Teachers can use the tool when marking assignments to ensure that the submitted content from students does not contain any AI generated content.\n",
    "3. Users can learn from the description of markings of AI content so that in future they can learn to avoid it themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this use may seem superfluous to some people, as markings of AI content might seem obvious, there is a portion of the online community that are not as media literate and cannot spot it as easily. Specifically, older generations of internet users can fall victim to this believing this content. Therefore, this design can not only augment learning, but represents older internet users as a tool to help them stay safe from false information on the internet."

    "Despite the positive applications this tool has there are some cultural and societal implications of a tool such as this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, although it can be used to flag AI content, society may begin to rely on this tool and begin not to trust any content unless it has bee proven otherwise. This means that trust between creators and consumers could deteriorate. Building on this, human creators could feel pressured to ensure their art does not conform to any AI standards even if they had been using it prior just so there work will not have a chance of being flagged. This may block artists and creators to reaching their full creative limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some privacy concerns with a tool such as this. Even though it will only begin scanning a user's screen on their request, it could be seen as intrusive to some users who would not want to have their screen captured. As well as this, there could be some issues in relation to Intellectual Property right. In order to be processed, the application would have to capture an image of the content, so, this could be breaching the Intellectual Property policy that means content cannot be replicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, if this application is to move forward, there is likely some adjustments that need made to conform to societal and culural requirements. Society will not be fully comfortable with a screen-scanning tool, so potentially adjusting to only scanning inserted content could avoid this. As well as this steps to not stigmatise AI content must be made to avoid creators fearing being labelled as such through the flagging made by the application."
